# hello-world

Hi, everyone!

You can call me Tobi. I'm currently a student at a community college, which I've been going to for the last 4 years. I messed up my first 2 years because I still had no idea what I wanted to do. At the beginning of my third year I decided to take a CS class. The first class wasn't all too bad, we only did programming on something called CeeBot. I had a lot of fun in that class, but I did not take the next course unitl summer. The next course actually had us programming in C++. Again, I really enjoyed the class. Then I took the next course in last fall and dropped out because I was having trouble. For the whole year I decided to take art classes. Fast forward to the spring, I bought a course off Udemy on developing games in C++. I was able to follow along, but then I stopped for no reason. It's been a year already and I have not done much. There are still a lot of courses I can take at my community college before transferring to a university, but my financial has run out. I keep asking myself why I want to learn programming. I want to learn because I want to develope games for the PC, console, or mobile. I still have a long road ahead of me. 

Hobbies: Drawing, playing games, learning something new.
